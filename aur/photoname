No cabal-dev binary found. ABORTING BUILD NOW!


The sort-of easy fix is:

   Install cabal-dev or cabal-dev-git from the AUR first

Also, if you're seeing problems, try doing a 'cabal update' before the 
makepkg to refresh the cabal lists. This is like pacman -Sy


What does this really mean? Read on..

The goal of installing this package is not to have its build deps
installed on your system, it's to have its binaries. To that end,
I chose to build it with cabal-dev which will build in a sandboxed
environment.

I don't want to make a decision as to the right way for you to get
cabal-dev installed on your system, so that's why we're here. You
need cabal-dev installed and I couldn't find one.
