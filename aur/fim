# I have tentatively removed the 'bison' and 'flex' deps since namcap indicates
# that they are not needed.

# I have also removed readline since it is required by bash. I also removed
# libtiff as a dep, since it is required by djvulibre, which is required by
# fim.

# namcap also listed libspectre as required but not included. not sure what
# provides libpng that is already included as a dep, but namcap said that it
# was already satisfied.

# I'm about to add sdl to the list of deps, per namcap.
